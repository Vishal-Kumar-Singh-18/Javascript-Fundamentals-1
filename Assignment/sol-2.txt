Q1.  Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?
sol- Operators in JavaScript are symbols that represent computations or operations on variables and values. They allow you to perform actions on one or more operands, which can be variables, literals, or expressions.    
						Operators are essential in programming because they provide the building blocks for expressing computations and operations in a concise and readable manner. They enable you to perform a wide range of tasks, from basic arithmetic to complex logical and bitwise operations, facilitating the development of robust and efficient programs.


Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.
sol- Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality. Here are the main categories:

1. Arithmetic Operations: Operators allow you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). These operations are fundamental for mathematical calculations in programming.

   var result = 10 + 5; // result is now 15

2. Assignment Operations: The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. This is a fundamental operation for storing and manipulating data.

   var x = 10; // assigns the value 10 to the variable x

3. Comparison Operations: Comparison operators (e.g., ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=) allow you to compare values and make decisions based on the result. These are essential for control flow in conditional statements.

   var a = 5;
   var b = 10;
   if (a < b) {
       // do something
   }

4. Logical Operations: Logical operators (e.g., &&, ||, !) are used to perform logical operations. They are crucial for creating complex conditions and controlling the flow of a program.

   var age = 25;
   var hasLicense = true;
   if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
       // can drive
   }

5. String Operations: In addition to numerical operations, operators can be used for string concatenation. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings.

   var firstName = "John";
   var lastName = "Doe";
   var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "John Doe"

6. Unary Operations: Some operators operate on a single operand. For example, the unary negation operator (-) can be used to negate a number.

   var num = 5;
   var negatedNum = -num; // negatedNum is -5

7. Increment and Decrement Operations: The `++` and `--` operators are used to increment and decrement variables, respectively.

   var count = 0;
   count++; // increment by 1
  
8. Bitwise Operations: JavaScript supports bitwise operators (e.g., &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>) for manipulating the binary representation of numbers.

   var num1 = 5; // binary: 101
   var num2 = 3; // binary: 011
   var result = num1 & num2; // bitwise AND: 001


Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
sol- In JavaScript, operators are classified based on the number of operands they work with. Here's a differentiation between unary, binary, and ternary operators, along with examples for each:

1. Unary Operators:
   - Definition: Unary operators work with only one operand.
   - Example:
     - Unary Plus (`+`) and Unary Negation (`-`)

     var num = 5;
     var unaryPlus = +num; // unary plus, result is 5
     var unaryNegation = -num; // unary negation, result is -5

     - Increment (`++`) and Decrement (`--`)

     var x = 10;
     x++; // increment, x is now 11

     - Logical NOT (`!`)

     var flag = true;
     var notFlag = !flag; // logical NOT, result is false

2. Binary Operators:
   - Definition: Binary operators work with two operands.
   - Example:
     - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`)

     var a = 10;
     var b = 5;
     var sum = a + b; // addition, result is 15
     var difference = a - b; // subtraction, result is 5

     - Assignment (`=`), Equality (`==`), Strict Equality (`===`)

     var x = 5;
     var y = 5;
     var isEqual = x === y; // strict equality, result is true

     - Logical AND (`&&`), Logical OR (`||`), Bitwise XOR (`^`)

     var condition1 = true;
     var condition2 = false;
     var logicalAND = condition1 && condition2; // logical AND, result is false

3. Ternary Operator:
   - Definition: Ternary operators work with three operands. The ternary operator is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement.
   - Example:
     - Conditional (Ternary) Operator (`? :`)

     var age = 20;
     var status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';

     In this example, if the condition `(age >= 18)` is true, the value of `status` will be `'Adult'`, otherwise, it will be `'Minor'`.


Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts 
important?
sol- Operator Precedence and Associativity are crucial concepts in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) as they determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing code that behaves as expected and for avoiding ambiguity.

Operator Precedence:

Definition: Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated when an expression has multiple operators.

Example:

var result = 5 + 10 * 2;

In this expression, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition. So, the multiplication operation `10 * 2` is performed first, and then the result is added to 5.

Common Precedence Levels:
1. Unary operators: `++, --, +, -, !`
2. Multiplication, division, and modulo: `*, /, %`
3. Addition and subtraction: `+, -`
4. Comparison operators: `<, >, <=, >=, ==, ===, !=, !==`
5. Logical AND: `&&`
6. Logical OR: `||`
7. Conditional (Ternary) operator: `? :`
8. Assignment operators: `=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=`

You can override the default precedence by using parentheses `()` to explicitly specify the order of evaluation.

Operator Associativity:

Definition: Operator associativity defines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left.

Example:

var result = 5 + 10 - 2;

In this case, both addition and subtraction have the same precedence, and the associativity is left-to-right. So, the expression is evaluated from left to right: `(5 + 10) - 2`.

Common Associativity:
- Left-to-right: Most operators, including assignment operators.
- Right-to-left: Unary operators, assignment operators, and the ternary operator (`? :`).

Why Understanding is Important:

1. Correctness of Expressions: Knowing operator precedence and associativity helps you write expressions that are evaluated in the intended order, avoiding errors and unexpected results.

2. Readability: Code readability is enhanced when operators are used in a way that aligns with their precedence and associativity. Others (or even yourself, in the future) can understand the code more easily.

3. Debugging: When an expression doesn't produce the expected result, understanding operator precedence and associativity is crucial for debugging and fixing the code.

4. Efficient Use of Parentheses: Explicitly using parentheses can make code more readable and can be necessary to ensure the intended order of evaluation.

In summary, these concepts are foundational for writing correct, readable, and maintainable code. They provide a set of rules that govern how expressions are processed by the JavaScript engine, ensuring that your code behaves predictably and as intended.
